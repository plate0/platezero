        Website <https://platezero.com>) and PlateZero Recipe and
        Food Management Technology. It is applicable to any "**User"**
        who initially sets up the PlateZero Service. Please read this
        document carefully, as it describes both your rights and your
        obligations as part of using the Service. Virtyx Technologies

    2.  If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company or
        other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to
        bind such entity and its affiliates to this TOS. If you do not
        have such authority, or if you do not agree with this TOS, you
        may not use the PlateZero Service. You acknowledge that this TOS
        is a contract between you and PlateZero, even though it is
        electronic and is not physically signed by you and PlateZero.

        change this TOS. If we make a material change to the TOS, we

        email address associated with your account or by posting a
        notice on the Site. You can review the most current version of
        the TOS at any time by visiting this page. The revised terms and
        conditions will become effective on the date set forth in our
        notice, and if you use the Service after that date, your use
        will constitute acceptance of the revised terms and conditions.

        which you may do through the process provided in the Service.

        evolve over time.

    12. In order for us to provide the Service to you, we require that
        you grant us certain rights with respect to Your Data. For
        example, we need to be able to store and copy Your Data in order

        to search it, to make backups to prevent data loss, and so on.

        grants us any such rights necessary to provide the service to
        you, only for the purpose of providing the service (and for no
        other purpose). This permission includes allowing us to use
        third-party service providers (such as Amazon Web Services) in
        the operation and administration of the Service and the rights
        granted to us are extended to these third parties to the degree
        necessary in order for the Service to be provided.

        OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SERVICES, AND NO INFORMATION, ADVICE OR

        CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL PLATEZERO BE LIABLE TO YOU
        OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
        EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST
        PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, OR (B) FOR ANY
        AMOUNT IN THE AGGREGATE IN EXCESS OF THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY
        YOU IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO
        YOUR CLAIM OR, IF NO FEES APPLY, FIVE HUNDRED (\$500) U.S.
        DOLLARS, OR (C) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. THE
        PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS TOS

    38. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied
        warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or

        PERMITTED BY LAW.

    the other of a Claim in writing. Notice of the Claim will include a
