title: PlateZero Monthly Update, April 2019
categories: update
---

Hi there, and welcome to PlateZero's first monthly update! We're very excited
that you've decided to create an account and we hope that this periodic email
will keep you up to date with what we're working on.

If for any reason you would not like to receive this monthly email in the
future, just shoot me a note and I will remove you from the list.

Development Updates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're continuing to push features out quickly! Here are a few of the things
we've recently deployed:

* Extended the period of time you'll be logged in for

  Previously, you'd be automatically logged out after a day, but we've made an
  update so you should no longer face the annoyance of needing to log back in
  frequently.

* Uploading images of recipes to import

  Ethan put a lot of work into fleshing out our OCR process for recipe uploads.
  We're using Google's vision API along with some custom workflow tooling to
  help us quickly process images that you upload to import.

  We're continuing to work on making this even faster and more seamless. Head
  on over to https://platezero.com/recipes/import and upload photos of your old
  recipe cards, soon you'll have them in your PlateZero account!

* History tab on recipe page

  A big part of why we're excited about PlateZero is our focus on how recipes
  are changed and iterated upon as you cook them again and again. When browsing
  your recipes, you'll notice a new History tab where you can see previous
  versions to help remind you what's been changed.

* Improved login flow for use with password managers

  Whatever password manager you use, using it to log in to PlateZero should now
  be a breeze! If you have trouble with this, please let us know!

Bug Reports / Feature Requests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to @Shanzy and to @bm for your bug reports! If you encounter any issues
while using PlateZero, something seems broken or if you just have an idea that
would make your life better, we'd love to hear about it!

To report a bug or suggest a feature, send an email to <bugs@platezero.com> or
to <ideas@platezero.com>. All email sent to either of these addresses gets added
to our issue tracker. We generally don't reply to the messages we receive at
these addresses unless we need clarification, but we do read and triage all of
them.

                                   ~~  ~~  ~~

exciting updates!

Best,
