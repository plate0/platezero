**_Recipe Remix Series:_** _We’re remixing and perfecting our recipes as we go-
just like you!  Each week, over the course of a month, we’ll share a recipe on
our blog and how we’ve changed it up.  Send us your suggestions [on
Twitter][twitter]!_

I’ve been perfecting and testing [this recipe][recipe] for some time and its
officially become my daughter’s favorite food that mommy makes.  One of the
biggest changes I made from the recipe I adapted it from is using pumpkin pie
spice as a replacement for nutmeg and cloves and baking it at a higher
temperature for a shorter time.  Try out the recipe with me this week and let me
know your ideas for next time.
