It’s week two of our Recipe Remix and this time we’re making a dairy-free
version of a favorite.

I’ve recently gone dairy-free and it's been hard not taking some tastes of the
pumpkin bead when I make it for my daughter. I decided to try and swap out the
butter for coconut oil.

The butter to oil ratio meant I needed ½ cup + 1 tablespoon of oil.  I tried
this variation with both liquid coconut oil and solid coconut oil. I found
liquid coconut oil is the best. Be prepared- the batter will seem much runnier
than when using butter. But when baked, the texture is slightly less dense and
delicious. My picky toddler didn’t notice the difference. When I tried the
solid coconut oil, I found the taste from the oil to be much stronger and the
edges became thicker and chewier. 

We’ve been sticking with the liquid coconut oil as our favorite version and I
pretend this healthy fat + the pumpkin makes this bread a health food ;)
