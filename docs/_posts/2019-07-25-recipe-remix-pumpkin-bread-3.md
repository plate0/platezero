We’re sticking with our favorite dairy-free version of pumpkin bread and adding
chocolate chips this time. I added 1 cup of Enjoy Life’s mini semi-sweet
chocolate chips to the finished batter and folded in. In my opinion, you can
never go wrong with chocolate and the warm bites fresh from the oven with melty
chocolate were delicious. It did feel a little decadent to have for breakfast in
the morning (a great way to get toddlers to eat pumpkin ;)), so we’re just
saving it for dessert.

I love that in PlateZero I can go back to different versions of my recipes
easily, so if you’re looking for the chocolatey goodness one or the original
