title: PlateZero Update, Early May 2019
categories: update
---

Well, it's technically a new month! We heard from a few of you that waiting a
whole month between updates is too long, so we're going to try doing this every
other week.

PlateZero currently has 22 registered users. To those of you who are new,
welcome! If you're interested, you can read last month's update here:
<https://platezero.com/announcements/2019/april-update.txt>.

We are always looking for new users; if you have people in mind who love to
cook, please invite them to sign up!

Development Updates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've been hard at work making PlateZero better. Here are a few highlights since
last month's update:

* Brand new recipe editor

  Now, it is much easier to edit your recipes. You can type in (or copy and
  paste) your ingredients and instructions in a natural way, and we'll display
  them nicely. No need to deal with multiple text boxes for different things,
  which gets challenging on small screens.

* New recipe pages

  We've updated the recipe page to a cleaner, simpler, and more beautiful
  layout. You can now upload pictures of your recipes where they will be
  featured prominently. Key details are quickly accessible right at the top,
  immediately followed by the ingredients and instructions. For recipes without
  images, the layout has also been cleaned up and simplified, really letting the
  recipe itself shine. Your recipes will also look nicer when printed out.

* Recipe search

  Once we started storing a lot of recipes in PlateZero, we started craving a
  way to search them. So now you can do that! If you click on Recipes in the nav
  bar, you'll notice a new search box that lets you filter through your recipes
  to find the one you're looking for.

* Importer improvements

  We revamped the flow for adding recipes to PlateZero. We've emphasized and
  provided specific UIs for the many places you can import recipes from,
  including websites, photos, and PDFs. We've also improved the accuracy of our
  website importer for several sites.

* Change your display name and avatar

  You asked, we delivered! You can now change your profile picture/avatar on the
  refreshed user page.

* More options for attribution

  As we continually adapt and improve upon recipes, it's nice to keep track of
  where we first saw them. So we've added more ways to do this! In addition to
  adding a URL source, you can now easily cite cookbooks by title/author/ISBN.

Shoutouts!

Thanks to brian, hbisthebest25, Shanzy, Shellsywellsy, and Tidal_Waverly for
your bug reports and suggestions! If you have any ideas or notice any problems
as you're using PlateZero, we would love to hear about them. You can send your

issue tracker, you can also email <bugs@platezero.com>.

Open Source
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're excited to have released our first bit of open source code! We've created
a library that is used both in the importer and in the recipe editor to parse
ingredients. If you're technically inclined, you can take a look here:
<https://github.com/plate0/ingredient-parser>. We'd be happy to accept pull
requests if you find improvements you'd like to make.

We're planning to make more of PlateZero open source in the coming weeks, so
stay tuned!

That's all for now! Enjoy PlateZero, and let us know if you have any feedback!
We're very interested to hear all of it.

Best,
Ben
