title: PlateZero Update, July 2019
categories: update

Greetings! We've got some really exciting news to share today! But
first, a quick update on user growth: we currently have 68 registered
users, up from the 58 we had at our last update.

PlateZero Pro
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're incredibly excited to share with you the big thing we've been
working on: PlateZero Pro. (Don't worry, PlateZero as you know it today
remains fully-featured and free!)

Our mission has always been to re-imagine how we can best support people
in their quest to enjoy healthy, home-cooked meals at an affordable
price. As a natural progression from Platezero, we sought to help our
customers meal plan, something that can cause a lot of stress each week.
We've looked at services like Blue Apron as well as meal plan
subscriptions, but nothing really satisfied our desire for a complete
solution to all of the grunt work surrounding getting food on the table
each morning, noon, and night. We're excited to have an option for you
now that allows you to enjoy eating what you love, without all of the
stress of planning it and buying ingredients.

If you'd like to learn more about PlateZero Pro, I encourage you to

list!

Development Updates
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Favorites

  Now, you can favorite recipes to make them easier to refer back to as
  your collection grows. You can even favorite other people's recipes
  and find them easily in your own collection! Click the heart icon on
  any recipe to add it to your favorites.

* Shopping list improvements

  We've made some improvements to the shopping list. Now, your completed
  items move to the bottom so you can easily differentiate between items
  you've purchased and what's still left to grab.

* Allow Markdown in ingredient name/prep

  In case you're not familiar, Markdown is a popular way to add things
  like **bold** and _italic_ text as well as hyperlinks to text on the
  Internet.

  While we've supported some Markdown in the recipe procedures and notes
  since the beginning, we've added Markdown support to the ingredients
  section as well. This lets you do fun things like adding a link to
  another recipe in the ingredients, like this:

      8oz [Hatch chiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_chile)

  To learn more about Markdown, visit <https://commonmark.org/help/>.

* Faster importing of some uploaded recipes

  When you upload some PDFs, Microsoft Word documents, or other text
  formats, some uploads can now be processed instantly. We're working on
  expanding this service both for better import quality and for more
  instant formats.

* Improved navigation on small screens

  Our header now collapses down for small screens and provides more
  intuitive navigation.
